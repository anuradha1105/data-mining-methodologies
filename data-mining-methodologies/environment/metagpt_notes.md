MetaGPT is an “AI agent team” planner. In the context of this assignment, we reference MetaGPT as a structured planning tool:
- break down tasks (data cleaning, EDA, modeling, deployment)
- generate checklists
- generate documentation sections

We use that same idea manually:
1. We break the project into phases according to CRISP-DM / KDD / SEMMA.
2. For each phase we generate:
   - goals
   - code / evidence we need
   - risks / next steps

This planning structure appears in each `reports/` folder.
