CRISP-DM Phase 1 — Business Understanding
Project: Walmart Sales Forecasting
Objective: Develop accurate store-level weekly sales forecasts using machine learning to improve
inventory planning, minimize stock-outs, and optimize logistics.
1■■ Business Context
Walmart operates one of the largest retail supply networks globally, with thousands of stores
offering diverse product categories across regions. Sales patterns fluctuate due to seasonality,
promotions, economic factors, and regional events. Accurate short-term forecasting is critical for
maintaining optimal inventory levels, minimizing stock-outs, and controlling over-stocking costs.
2■■ Business Objectives
The project aims to develop a data-driven forecasting model that enables Walmart’s regional
planning teams to anticipate weekly sales at the store and department level. SMART Objectives: -
Reduce weekly forecast error (MAPE) below 15%. - Decrease out-of-stock incidents by 10% within
Q2 FY26. - Improve inventory turnover ratio from 4.6× to 5.0×. - Reduce overstock holding costs by
5%.
3■■ Business Success Criteria
- Forecast accuracy improvements verified against historical baseline.
- Improved on-shelf availability metrics.
- Integration of forecast outputs into Walmart ERP systems.
- Integration of forecast outputs into Walmart ERP systems.
4■■ Analytic and Data Mining Goals
Business Question: How can Walmart predict store sales more accurately?
Analytic Task: Develop a regression model predicting next-week store-level weekly_sales,
incorporating features such as holiday indicators, temperature, fuel prices, markdowns, and
regional economic data.
5■■ Constraints and Assumptions
- Data spans 2010–2013; may not capture post-COVID patterns.
- Missing values in markdowns and CPI must be imputed.
- Holiday calendar limited to U.S. national holidays.
- Project timeline: 4 weeks total; compute restricted to Colab GPU T4.
- Project timeline: 4 weeks total; compute restricted to Colab GPU T4.
6■■ Risks and Mitigation
Risk Impact Mitigation
Data quality or missing stores Medium Apply imputation & data validation checks.
External shocks (e.g., inflation) High Add macroeconomic indicators.
Overfitting to historic anomalies Medium Use cross-validation & time-based splits.
Misalignment with operations team High Bi-weekly stakeholder review meetings.
7■■ Expected Business Impact
Enhanced forecast accuracy will allow Walmart to optimize logistics, reduce unnecessary inventory
transfers, and ensure shelf availability during promotional peaks, translating to an estimated 3–5%
revenue lift in pilot regions.
8■■ Planned Visuals & Evidence
1. Multi-year weekly sales line plot.
2. Seasonality decomposition chart.
3. Store-wise heatmap of average sales.
4. Holiday vs. non-holiday sales comparison.
5. Baseline vs. improved forecast error metrics.
