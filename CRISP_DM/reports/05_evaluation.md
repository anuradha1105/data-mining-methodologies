## 5.3 Business Success Criteria Check
| Criterion | Target | Achieved | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| MAPE < 15 % | âœ… Target | â‰ˆ 11 % | Met |
| Forecast 1 week ahead | âœ… Implemented | âœ… | Met |
| Model generalizable across stores | Yes | Yes | Met |

âœ… **Conclusion:** The model meets or exceeds the defined business objectives for forecast accuracy.

## 5.4 Technical Evaluation
- **Residual Distribution:** Centered around 0 â†’ no systematic bias.  
- **Predicted vs Actual:** Points cluster near the 45Â° line â†’ good fit.  
- **Drift Check:** No major increase in error over time.  

## 5.5 Model Interpretability
Top features by importance (Random Forest / XGBoost):

1. Rolling_4wk_Avg â€“ recent trend memory ðŸ“ˆ  
2. Prev_Week_Sales â€“ momentum effect ðŸ•’  
3. IsHoliday â€“ seasonal spike ðŸŽ‰  
4. WeekOfYear â€“ captures annual seasonality ðŸ“…  
5. Fuel_Price / CPI â€“ economic context ðŸ’²  

## 5.6 Risks and Limitations
- May underpredict extreme events (e.g., Black Friday).  
- Macroeconomic shock â†’ model drift.  
- No promotion/discount data included.  
- Lag/rolling features depend on consistent weekly reporting.

## 5.7 Recommendations
- Retrain monthly with latest data.  
- Add promotion and store-event variables in next iteration.  
- Deploy as automated forecast dashboard with alerts for high/low demand.  

## 5.8 Deployment Readiness Assessment
| Aspect | Evaluation |
|:--|:--|
| Accuracy | High ( â‰ˆ 11 % MAPE ) |
| Stability | Good across stores |
| Interpretability | Adequate via feature importance |
| Retraining Complexity | Moderate |
| Business Impact | Strong ( supports inventory & labor planning ) |

âœ… **Overall Readiness:** **Approved for Pilot Deployment**
