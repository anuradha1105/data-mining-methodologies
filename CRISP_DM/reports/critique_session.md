CRISP-DM Phase 1 ‚Äî Business Understanding (Executive Rewrite)
Business Context
‚Ä®Walmart, the world‚Äôs largest retailer, manages millions of weekly transactions across thousands of stores. Demand fluctuates sharply with promotions, regional events, and holidays. Accurately forecasting weekly sales is critical for balancing inventory, reducing operational waste, and improving customer satisfaction. This initiative supports Walmart‚Äôs strategic objective of data-driven retail optimization.‚Ä®
Business Objectives
‚Ä®The initiative aims to build a forecasting solution that enables Walmart‚Äôs operations and finance teams to predict department-level weekly sales one week in advance.‚Ä®
SMART Targets:
üéØ Reduce forecast error (MAPE) below 15% within Q2 FY 2026.
üì¶ Lower out-of-stock incidents by 10% and overstock costs by 5%.
üí∞ Increase inventory turnover from 4.6√ó to 5.0√ó.
üïì Deliver fully automated weekly forecasts integrated into existing ERP systems.
Analytic Objectives
‚Ä®Translate the business challenge ‚ÄúHow can Walmart anticipate next week‚Äôs demand?‚Äù into the data-science goal:‚Ä®Build and evaluate a regression-based forecasting model that predicts Weekly_Sales per store‚Äìdepartment, incorporating historical sales, holiday indicators, temperature, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment, and promotional markdowns.‚Ä®Deliverables include a modular pipeline supporting retraining and deployment via API for weekly automation.‚Ä®

CRISP-DM Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Preparation (Executive Rewrite)
Objective
‚Ä®Prepare a high-quality, analytically consistent dataset that encapsulates both temporal dynamics and business drivers of Walmart‚Äôs weekly sales. This phase ensures all features are reliable, interpretable, and aligned with the forecasting goal.‚Ä®
Data Cleaning and Validation
‚Ä®- Verified unique keys (Store + Dept + Date) ‚Äî no duplicates.‚Ä®- Addressed missing values:‚Ä®  - CPI (~2%) ‚Üí store-level median imputation.‚Ä®  - Prev_Week_Sales first-week missing ‚Üí 0 with justification not to bias subsequent rolling windows.‚Ä®- Detected extreme holiday sales spikes; retained but flagged via a binary IsBlackFriday feature to preserve context without distorting averages.‚Ä®
Feature Engineering
Category
Engineered Feature
Description / Purpose
Temporal
WeekOfYear, Year
Capture seasonal and annual patterns.
Lag & Rolling
Prev_Week_Sales, Rolling_4wk_Avg
Embed short-term memory of recent performance.
Holiday/Event
IsHoliday, IsBlackFriday
Reflect holiday impact on sales peaks.
Statistical
Weekly_Sales_Log
Stabilize variance and normalize distribution.
Derived Ratios
Store_Size_Sales_Ratio, Sales_vs_Temp_Index (optional)
Add business interpretability.
‚Ä®Each feature was validated through correlation analysis against Weekly_Sales to ensure statistical relevance and avoid redundancy.‚Ä®
Scaling and Encoding
‚Ä®- Scaling: Applied z-score standardization to continuous features (Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment) to ensure uniform influence on gradient-based models.‚Ä®- Encoding: Categorical features (Store Type, IsHoliday) transformed using binary or one-hot encoding for model readability.‚Ä®
Temporal Integrity and Split Strategy
‚Ä®- Sorted records by Store and Date; no forward data used in feature construction.‚Ä®- Training set = earliest 75% of weeks; Validation set = most recent 25%.‚Ä®- Ensures chronological authenticity and prevents data leakage from future observations.‚Ä®
Feature Evaluation
‚Ä®A correlation heatmap revealed strong positive relationships between Prev_Week_Sales and Weekly_Sales (œÅ ‚âà 0.88) and a moderate link for Rolling_4wk_Avg (œÅ ‚âà 0.76).‚Ä®Feature importance ranking from a baseline XGBoost model confirmed these variables as key predictors, validating their inclusion.‚Ä®

Executive Summary
‚Ä®The data preparation phase transformed raw transactional data into a structured, predictively rich dataset. Through careful feature engineering and temporal validation, the pipeline now captures both operational memory and seasonal dynamics. Remaining enhancements include promotion data integration and multicollinearity reduction. The dataset is ready for model development in Phase 4 ‚Äì Modeling.‚Ä®
