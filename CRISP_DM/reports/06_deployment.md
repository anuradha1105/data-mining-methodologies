CRISP-DM Phase 6 — Deployment (Executive Rewrite)
Objective
The deployment phase ensures that the Walmart weekly sales forecasting model transitions from prototype to operational use — delivering timely, actionable insights to store, regional, and corporate decision-makers. The focus is on reliability, scalability, and continuous improvement through a structured MLOps framework.
Deployment Architecture Overview
The model outputs weekly store-level forecasts that are automatically exported and distributed through Walmart’s analytics ecosystem.
Proposed Architecture:Data Ingestion (Sales, CPI, Fuel, Unemployment)    ↓Feature Engineering Pipeline (ETL / Airflow)    ↓Model Scoring (XGBoost API / Batch Prediction)    ↓Prediction Storage (Data Warehouse / S3 / SQL)    ↓Visualization (Power BI / Tableau Dashboards)    ↓Monitoring & Feedback Loop (MAPE tracking, drift detection)
Deployment Strategy
Forecasts are automatically generated every week using the latest available data. Predictions are stored in a centralized data warehouse (walmart_sales_predictions) and simultaneously exported to dashboards and reporting layers. The system supports both batch deployment (scheduled forecasts) and future-ready API deployment (on-demand scoring via FastAPI).
Artifact
Description
walmart_sales_predictions.csv
Weekly forecast results for each store.
Model API Endpoint
REST interface for real-time scoring.
Power BI Dashboard
Interactive visualization for store managers.
Operational Dashboard
An interactive Power BI or Plotly dashboard displays:- Actual vs Predicted Sales: Blue vs red time-series curves- Error Trends: Weekly MAPE evolution and drift alerts- Store-Level Drilldowns: Identify top under/over-performing stores- Holiday Analysis: Compare seasonal deviations and model response

Monitoring & Drift Management
- Technical Drift: Automated MAPE trend and feature drift (via Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests).- Business Drift: Sudden macroeconomic changes or store-level anomalies trigger early retraining.- Alerting: Notifications pushed to Slack / Teams when MAPE > threshold or missing data detected.
Risks and Mitigation
Risk
Impact
Mitigation
Model drift due to unforeseen trends
High
Continuous monitoring and event-based retraining.
Missing or corrupted input data
Medium
ETL data validation layer before model run.
Dashboard latency
Medium
Implement caching or incremental data refresh.
Version confusion during updates
High
Model registry and version tagging.
Loss of explainability
Medium
Integrate SHAP-based interpretability in dashboard.
Future Roadmap
1. Deploy forecasting microservice via FastAPI integrated with Walmart’s internal systems.2. Automate retraining pipeline using Airflow DAG (data validation → retrain → evaluate → deploy).3. Implement MAPE drift dashboard for continuous observability.4. Introduce promotion, weather, and event features for accuracy improvement.5. Expand to multi-horizon forecasts (2–4 weeks ahead).
Executive Summary
The Walmart forecasting solution is deployment-ready, delivering forecast accuracy of ~11% MAPE and robust operational performance. With its structured data refresh and retraining schedule, defined ownership, and clear integration roadmap, the system is poised for production rollout.A shift from manual CSV exports to automated, monitored MLOps pipelines will further enhance scalability, governance, and business agility — ensuring that every store manager receives trustworthy, data-driven insights weekly.
