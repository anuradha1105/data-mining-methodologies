# Phase 6 â€“ Deployment

## 6.1 Goal
The goal of this phase is to make the predictive modelâ€™s results available to decision-makers in a usable and reliable form.  
The deployment ensures that the Walmart weekly sales forecasting model is integrated into business operations for real-time or scheduled insights.

---

## 6.2 Deployment Strategy
We simulated deployment by generating weekly sales forecasts for all stores and exporting the results to a CSV file.

**Deployment Artifact:**  
- `walmart_sales_predictions.csv`  
- Columns: `Store`, `Date`, `Weekly_Sales` (actual), `Predicted_Sales` (forecasted)  

This file can be:
- Imported into **Power BI / Tableau** for dashboard visualization  
- Uploaded to a **Walmart internal data warehouse** for automated reporting  
- Used by managers to identify high/low sales weeks in advance  

---

## 6.3 Example Dashboard Visualization
An interactive time-series chart was created using Plotly:

- **Blue line:** Actual weekly sales  
- **Red line:** Predicted weekly sales  
- **Insight:** Strong alignment between actual and forecasted values; deviations visible near major holidays.

## 6.4 Model Maintenance Plan
| Task | Frequency | Responsibility |
|------|------------|----------------|
| Data refresh | Weekly | Data engineering team |
| Model retraining | Monthly or after major economic changes | Data science team |
| Performance tracking | Continuous (MAPE monitoring) | Analytics team |
| Business review | Quarterly | Management |

---

## 6.5 Deployment Risks
- Model drift if new trends emerge (e.g., supply chain disruptions).  
- Need for automated data quality checks before retraining.  
- Forecast accuracy may degrade if external factors (promotions, new competitors) are ignored.

---

## 6.6 Future Enhancements
- Deploy the model as a **FastAPI / Flask microservice** for real-time querying.  
- Integrate with **BI dashboards** for daily visibility.  
- Add features like promotions, store events, or regional weather forecasts.  
- Schedule retraining using **Airflow** or **Prefect** pipelines.

---

## 6.7 Summary
- âœ… Model accuracy achieved target (MAPE â‰ˆ 11%)  
- âœ… Forecasts exported successfully  
- âœ… Deployment-ready CSV and dashboard created  
- ðŸš€ Next step: Integrate into production workflow and monitor performance regularly.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The CRISP-DM lifecycle has been successfully completed.  
The Walmart weekly sales forecast model is ready for operational use and ongoing maintenance through a structured MLOps process.
